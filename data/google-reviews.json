      "text": "Had a wonderful service duration up until my move date. Because Openserve had issues with my address (which is the only thing I got from my rental agency) when we moved in, my install was delayed for 2 months when I moved in. Now I am moving and apparently my service can't be moved, it has to be cancelled and also reapplied for at the new premises, meaning I need to pay double for fibre. Just make sure you understand this process before you get into this contract, you can't move it, you have to let it run for the duration of the year whether you live there or not. And you'll be paying double for a new service at your new flat.\n\nUPDATE: At least you can cancel with a calendar's month notice and you can get a new service some place else with reduced first month payment so the fact that you'll be essentially paying for fibre at a premises you no longer live at isn't so bad. Also, they only account your install date, not the actual application date which in my case was 6 weeks. Sorry that a wonderful service had to come to such an end.",
