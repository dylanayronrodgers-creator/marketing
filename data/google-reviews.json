After attempting two line resets a ticket was logged at 12:00. At 12:15 I received a call from Marvel with the cause (hight traffic) and a solution (router upgrade).

We have a SERIOUS ISSUE with your Grandstream handset that we should be using to receive phone calls but instead it does not ring and we only can make phone calls with it. I called your helpline 3 weeks back and spoke to numerous call centre agents and none of them managed to help. A specific agent I spoke to was a lady named Ntombi who managed to get the phone to ring for only one day then after that, it stopped working. I am not the only one from my company who has tried resolving this matter. It has been years upon years with us battling with this particular problem and Axxesss not hearing our demands for a service we pay every month for. We are losing valuable customers because of this and if this continues, we will have to cancel our service with Axxess and get better service and help elsewhere. On July the 11th at 3:31pm one of my co workers sent you the same query message that I am sending today and you did not respond to her email. I have called your helpline more than 15 times and I was put on hold for over 45 mins and they took down my number and said they will call me back but to this day, no one has called me yet. This problem has to be solved, enough is enough!",

I have paid for my router after checking the address to make sure. Only a day after I received a message to say they dont service that specific place and there is no internet lines there. I immediately ask to stop the router delivery because I will obviously not be able  to use it. I asked to get the router refunded, because it wasnt due to my fault. Well I am still waiting for refund.",

The speeds are fantastic, the ping is consistently low, and I've had no issues with lag or buffering during peak hours. A top-tier service for anyone with heavy internet usage. It's just exactly on par with what I was looking for.",

Axxess has been the worst ISP experience I’ve had in South Africa. Over the past five weeks, we’ve dealt with ongoing internet issues—including two full weeks without any service at all—and received little to no support during that time.\n\nWhen we finally got assistance from Zukile, we had a brief moment of hope. He was communicative for about a week and promised to stay with us throughout the process until everything was fixed. He even provided a temporary router—which came with its own set of problems—but when we asked for help with those issues, it felt like we were being seen as ungrateful or unreasonable for simply needing support.\n\nTo try to ease communication, I personally took over from my dad to make Zukile feel more comfortable engaging with me instead. I even reassured him that he could respond by the following workday. Despite this, he began misreading tone from text messages and interpreted my calm, reasonable follow-up as me being pushy or not understanding that he’s busy. It felt like a complete shift from the initial helpfulness we experienced.\n\nAs we neared the end of the process, we stopped receiving updates for over three days. When we tried to follow up, Zukile took offense—despite our frustration being entirely justified after weeks of unresolved issues and no clear timeline.\n\nThe support system at Axxess is completely unreliable. There are no technicians available to assist in person, and phone support is just as bad. Multiple agents have ended calls mid-support, claiming their shifts were over, and many speak to you with condescension or impatience—as if you’re a burden for needing help or trying to understand basic troubleshooting steps.\n\nWe are planning on cancelling our line, and honestly, we feel more relief than disappointment. We were still charged half of the monthly service fees despite having no internet connection or service at all. On top of that, I’ve spent over R2,000 on mobile data just to stay online and keep working.\n\nAxxess is a truly horrific service provider. Learn from my mistake—stay far away.",

Even the migration didn't come with any issues. Whenever the line is down, they will advise and if I query, they are generally very quick to assist, together with the fibre provider. They upgraded our line, at no additional cost. which helps when online gaming. The service is one of a kind and I will not change, unless they kick me out. Thank you Axxess! Keep up the great services, which is a breath of fresh air in the current service delivery climate.",
