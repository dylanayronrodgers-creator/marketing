After logging ticket:##25d43heb22, i was told to adjust my router's network settings. I am unable to find those network settings and informed Axxess on 02-Feb-2026. If there are setting to be changed why do you not inform your customers beforehand? Now that i have cancelled (because of Axxess's poor service), am i expected to have no internet access for the next two months? Axxess must learn to communicate and help customers",

      "text": "The fibre lines have been intermittent. Today all their clients have authentication issues. Many of us pay exorbitant prices for fibre so we can work online. Now we can't work. Also we have to spend hundreds more on back up. Why are we paying such high fees just to have to spend all our money on back up internet? Not only do we lose out on income we get fined if we cannot carry out our duties. This irregularity is becoming a regular occurrence. All that they can say is apologies. How is that going to help us who are struggling to get money in? Edit: It's back up but when will it just decide to randomly have issues again as it does USELESS service. I have to do my work. Third time in two days it goes down. Clean up your act we pay too much for such uselessness.Tired of pathetic service. I called four times today totalling ³ and a half hours. No one could help me. They said frogfoot then frogfoot days Axxess now it's Eastern Cape. I lost out on income. Axxess should give clients discounts or reduced rates. Apologies don't cut it when your livelihood is on the line.",

We'd have the line reset, reboot the router, have good speeds and then it would drop shortly after.\n\nOn Friday morning I reported the issue via WhatsApp (very convenient!l). After attempting two line resets a ticket was logged at 12:00. At 12:15 I received a call from Marvel with the cause (hight traffic) and a solution (router upgrade). By 13:15 I collected my new router from Marvel at their offices.\n\nThanks for the continued support with your services.",

      "text": "They have good processes in place and are committed to good service and have good support availability. They seem unable to expedite the same good levels of service from their bulk providers like Openserve. Sometimes the support staff struggle to understand subtleties of an issue.\n\nUpdate: I must downgrade my review. Their service is automated to the point of insanity. Management are invisible and indifferent.  Tech support agents don't look at history and do not apply their minds. They seem to have just about everything that distinguishes them as thinking humans squeezed out of them. Granted they are the subjects in a poorly designed system that leaves them helpless to do much more that serve as a postbox to somewhere else.",

Constant issues with upload and download speed.  IP address issues and all I get is a please hold.  Now feedback, no help, the most useless company ever.  I used free minutes, 30 minutes and a R100 airtime to try and sort out my problems and it is either not their problem or they can't help me or ish sorry I don't know what is going on and if you ask to speak to a supervisor you are put on hold and they never get back to you.\nMy previous company used only\nAxxess as we knew the owners very well and wanted to support a small business, now I will NOT suggest anyone to use them.  Totally pathetic.\nI phoned them today again with the same issues that I am having and guess what, I get put on hold after asking to speak to a supervisor.",

      "text": "I used to think Axxess was one of the better ISP's out there and used to be happy with their service, but I have grown extremely disappointed in their customer service. They have certainly gone backwards. I now have 2 unresolved tickets that no one even bothers to reply to even when I follow up. Not mentioning their chats where the agents simply drop you. This on top of me experiencing intermittent connectivity and logging faults and complaints. Going on for months now. The only thing keeping me from cancelling was a glimmer of faith in past performance but sadly all trust and confidence have now dissipated. They are officially worse than Telkom and I'll be switching to another ISP.",
