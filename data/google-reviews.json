For the most part, my interactions with Axxess in this regards was fairly simple and painless.\nWhen I moved to another place, I decided to get fibre through them and cancel the mobile internet. It has been two months and so far all they keep doing is saying that the line is activated, even though no one has bothered to come and install a line to the house. They send me invoices and even deduct money from my card, regardless of there not being any line to the house. To get a refund from them has also been frustrating.\nI've tried phoning them, emails and even their text assistant on their website. No one can resolve this and everyone keeps pointing to other departments or say that someone will contact me. No one called.\n\nI don't think its a bad idea to get fibre from them, but for the love of sanity, make sure they don't mess up the address on their end and find out if there no fibre line already active on that address. Also, get a timeline as to when the fibre will be installed and keep following up on the progress, as they never make contact first.",

This on top of me experiencing intermittent connectivity and logging faults and complaints. Going on for months now.

We tried to contact Axxcess to help us with this issue and the phone will receive phone calls for one day and the next day back to not working! It is affecting our business!! This is one of the emails I sent to them:\n\nGood morning,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. We have a SERIOUS ISSUE with your Grandstream handset that we should be using to receive phone calls but instead it does not ring and we only can make phone calls with it. I called your helpline 3 weeks back and spoke to numerous call centre agents and none of them managed to help. A specific agent I spoke to was a lady named Ntombi who managed to get the phone to ring for only one day then after that, it stopped working. I am not the only one from my company who has tried resolving this matter. It has been years upon years with us battling with this particular problem and Axxesss not hearing our demands for a service we pay every month for. We are losing valuable customers because of this and if this continues, we will have to cancel our service with Axxess and get better service and help elsewhere. On July the 11th at 3:31pm one of my co workers sent you the same query message that I am sending today and you did not respond to her email. I have called your helpline more than 15 times and I was put on hold for over 45 mins and they took down my number and said they will call me back but to this day, no one has called me yet. This problem has to be solved, enough is enough!",

I logged a service ticket and it was back to normal for less than a week and the process repeated for about 3 weeks after which my tickets were ignored and the responses changed to the service is not throttled while it is and speed test proof was supplied.",

      "text": "I have always had excellent service and help. When I relocated it was handled professionally. They arrived the day they said they would and left the house as if they were never here. I would definitely recommend Axxess to friends and family without a doubt. I work from home so a reliable, fast wifi connection is very important. i am very happy and don't have any complaints. I moved from KZN to WP and what a pleasure to not have to worry about my wifi.",

One phonecall is all it takes to get my service back on track working. It's also such a pleasurable experience engaging with courteous & friendly call centre agents who do their absolute best to ensure that the job has been completed & I'm connected  before that call has ended. Well done Axxess!!!!!✔️",
